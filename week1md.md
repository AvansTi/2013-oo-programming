## 1. The program and the source code

### 1.1 Source code

A computer program is composed of commands written in the _source_ code. A computer generally runs _commands_ in the source code from top to bottom and from left to right. Source code is saved in a textual format and will be executed somehow.

### 1.2 Commands
Computers execute different operations, or actions, based on the commands. For example, when printing the text "Hello world!" on the screen, it is done by the command System.out.println.

```java
System.out.println("Hello world!");
```

The System.out.println command prints the string given inside the brackets on the screen. The suffix ln is short for the word line. Therefore, this command prints out a line. This means that after the given string has been printed, the command will also print a line break.
